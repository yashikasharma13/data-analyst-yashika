Data Wrangling 
Project Description: Data Wrangling for Customer Analytics at XYZ Company
/Project Title: Data Wrangling for Enhanced Customer Analytics at XYZ Company
/Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data wrangling to prepare a robust dataset for customer analytics at XYZ Company. By cleaning, transforming, and consolidating data from various sources, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and usability of customer data for subsequent analysis and reporting.
Background: XYZ Company has accumulated customer data from multiple channels, including sales transactions, customer service interactions, and marketing campaigns. However, this data is often inconsistent, incomplete, or fragmented, making it challenging to derive meaningful insights. Effective data wrangling will facilitate better decision-making and more targeted marketing strategies.
Dataset: The data wrangling process will involve various datasets, including:
•	Sales Data: Transaction records that include customer IDs, purchase amounts, product details, and timestamps.
•	Customer Information: Demographic details such as age, gender, location, and account creation date.
•	Customer Service Records: Logs of customer inquiries, complaints, and resolutions.
•	Marketing Interaction Data: Email and campaign response data, including open rates and click-through rates.
Methodology:
1-	Data Collection:
o	Gather datasets from various sources, including internal databases, CRM systems, and third-party marketing platforms.
o	Ensure that all relevant datasets are identified for a comprehensive customer profile.
2-	Data Assessment:
o	Conduct an initial assessment of the data quality to identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across different datasets.
o	Document data types, formats, and any discrepancies.
3-	Data Cleaning:
o	Address missing values through appropriate methods (e.g., imputation or exclusion) based on their significance and context.
o	Remove duplicate records and correct inconsistencies in data formats (e.g., date formats, naming conventions).
o	Normalize categorical variables to ensure consistency across datasets (e.g., standardizing customer status as "active," "inactive," etc.).
4-	Data Transformation:
o	Perform data type conversions to ensure that all fields are in suitable formats for analysis (e.g., converting strings to datetime objects).
o	Derive new features that may aid in analytics, such as total purchase amounts, frequency of purchases, or customer tenure.
o	Aggregate data as necessary to ensure that it aligns with the intended analysis (e.g., summarizing monthly sales per customer).
5-	Data Consolidation:
o	Merge datasets into a unified customer database, ensuring that all relevant information is linked accurately through unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID).
o	Create a comprehensive view of each customer by combining sales, support, and marketing data.
7-	Documentation and Validation:
o	Document the data wrangling process, including data sources, cleaning methods, and transformations applied to the dataset.
o	Validate the final dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to confirm accuracy and completeness.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python (using libraries like Pandas and NumPy) or R for data manipulation and cleaning.
•	SQL for data extraction and initial assessment of data from relational databases.
•	Jupyter Notebook or RStudio for interactive data wrangling and documentation.
•	Visualization tools (like Matplotlib or Seaborn) to assist with EDA and quality checks.
Deliverables:
•	A cleaned and transformed customer dataset ready for analysis, available in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel Database).
•	A comprehensive report documenting the data wrangling process, including challenges encountered, methods employed, and final dataset characteristics.
•	Visualizations illustrating the key data insights and confirmations of data quality checks conducted during the process.
Timeline:
•	Expected completion of the project: 6 weeks, including phases for assessment, cleaning, transformation, and documentation.
This data wrangling project aims to establish a high-quality dataset that enables XYZ Company to conduct effective customer analytics, ultimately enhancing marketing strategies, improving customer service, and driving overall business growth.
